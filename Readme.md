# Juggy Driver App

The Juggy Driver App is a powerful application designed specifically for drivers who are responsible for picking up orders from stores and delivering them to customers. This app seamlessly integrates with our other two applications, Juggy Storefront and Juggy Customers, to provide a comprehensive delivery management system.

## Functionality

Upon logging in to the Juggy Driver App, drivers are presented with an intuitive interface that facilitates efficient order management. Here's how the app works:

- **Map View**: Drivers are greeted with a map display that shows their current location and a polyline connecting it to the destination location, which is the customer's address. This provides a visual representation of the pickup and delivery route.

- **Navigation**: After reviewing the map, drivers can initiate turn-by-turn navigation by simply pressing the "Navigate" button. The app provides detailed directions, ensuring drivers can easily follow the most optimized route to reach their destination promptly.

- **Meeting Room**: In addition to the navigation feature, drivers have the option to join a virtual meeting room where they can engage in video calls with customers and other stakeholders. This facilitates effective communication, enabling drivers to address any concerns or queries related to the delivery.
